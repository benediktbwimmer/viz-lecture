# Homework 2

## Objective

Find a freely availably API on the internet and use it to create a Python script that:

- retrieves data from the API for a specific time period or point in time;
- creates an interesting plot of the data;
- saves the plot to a file in a subfolder named `plots/`;

The script should accept one command line argument for the time period or point in time. 
Run the script 5 times with different arguments (e.g different dates or time periods) and save the plots to the `plots/` subfolder.

Use a .env file if your API requires an API key, but do not include the .env file in your submission. (You can use a .env.example file to show what the .env file should look like.)

## Submission
Submit a single .zip file containing:
- the Python script;
- the .env.example file;
- the plots/ subfolder with the saved plots;
- a README.md file with instructions on how to run the script and a brief description of the API used and what the data represents.
- a requirements.txt file with the required libraries.

The .zip file should be named:
`<last_name>_<first_name>_homework2.zip`
where you replace `<last_name>` and `<first_name>` with your actual surname and given name.
